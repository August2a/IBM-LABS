* LAB501. For full details see the Exercise Guide.                      
* In this lab, you will code instructions that                          
* edit decimal (packed) numbers

* Standard z/OS program prolog (do not change these)                    
* Ignore this for now, it will be explained in the next course          
* 1. Save my caller's registers in their save area                      
         STM   14,12,12(13)    Save caller's registers                  
* 2. Establish my base register                                         
         LARL  12,LAB501       Load the address of LAB501 into R12      
         USING LAB501,12       Use R12 as base register                 
* 3. Chain the save areas                                               
         LA    15,SAVEAREA     R15 temporarily points to my save area

**********************  Lab instructions ****************************** 
* The comment lines below direct you to write instructions that         
* format (edit) decimal numbers.                                        
* When you want to check your instructions, submit the job.             
* Like in the previous Unit 4 labs (LAB4xx), you will copy data         
* to a print line, and the program will print it.                       
* You will see the result at the end of the job listing.                
* The instructions needed to make printing work have been               
* written for you. Ignore them for the time being. You will             
* learn about them in the next course.
