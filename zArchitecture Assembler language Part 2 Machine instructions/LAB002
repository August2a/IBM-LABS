* Another topic from Part 1: Defining character, hex, and bit strings.  
* This program does not contain executable code, only data definitions. 
**********************  Lab instructions ****************************** 
* Each line following "Program data", below, contains instructions      
* to write data definition statements.                                  
* Follow the instructions and then submit this job.                     
* Check the Assembler listing to verify that the definitions            
* are as expected (see the Exercise Guide for details).
